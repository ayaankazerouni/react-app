          I'm a Computer Science graduate student at Virginia Tech, engaged in research related to CS education.
          More specifically, I collect log data as students program in the Eclipse IDE, and am attempting to use
          that data to empirically determine if students are practicing incremental, test-driven development.
          <br/><br/>
          With this information, we hope to have interventions that might change student programming habits for
          the better. Read more at my <a href="https://people.cs.vt.edu/~ayaan/" target="_blank">personal website</a>.

          As the presentation layer, the front-end team together with the UX team are responsible for a user's first
          and possibly lasting impression of a web product, regardless of the product's funtionality itself. I like the
          idea that small tweaks on the front-end can lead to lasting impressions on a user.
          <br/><br/>
          Further, there's a lot of scope for creativity with the number of different devices a website or application
          might be accessed from. Mobile calculators are a great example of apps in portrait mode looking complete different
          in landscape, going so far as to change the scope of functionality available.

        <h3 className="title title-3">The Application</h3>
        <p className="text">
          This is a voting application where you can vote for the winner of 2017's Bahama Llama competition. It's a single page application, and the links make this more like a tabbed application (the browser
          never has to reload to do anything). The table of poll results on the side (on desktop) and at the bottom (on
          mobile) updates in real-time as votes are gathered.
        </p>
        <h3 className="title title-3">Technologies Used</h3>
        <p className="text">
          This 'web application' was built as part of the application to the Front End Developer Internship position at
          Zappos. The technologies used here are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>: I've wanted to spend some time
                working in React for quite a while, and this was the perfect opportunity. React lets me modularise my
                front-end, so that each page has one or more 'working parts' (components). React is also very smart about updating the DOM (if you follow the rules and don't mess around). A few React libraries really
                helped me out: <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/react-router" target="_blank">React Router</a> was
                helpful in routing so that the browser never has to do a full reload, and <a
                href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-modal-dialog" target="_blank">React Modal Dialog</a> helped out with
                displaying Llama Bios. After all, I can't have you voting for a Llama without knowing what they stand
                for.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>: I wrote most of the jQuery used here, but I
                must give credit to the <a href="http://rvera.github.io/image-picker/" target="_blank">Image
                Picker</a> jQuery plugin I used to choose Llamas on the Vote page.
                <br/>
                Side note: React does NOT like it if other libraries affect the DOM. Use with caution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://webpack.github.io/" target="_blank">Webpack</a>: To bundle client side modules and make
                them available through Node's require statement (also reducing the number of script tags polluting the
                HTML).
            </li>
            <li>
              HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript: I used certain ES6 expressions, relying on transpilers to make them compatible
              with browsers that have yet to adopt the new JavaScript.
              <br/><br/>
              I dealt with most (if not all) responsiveness issues with CSS. I usually use
              Bootstrap for quick and easy responsiveness in my academic-related work, but I decided not to do that for
              this challenge.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank">Babel</a>: For transpiling ES6 and JSX code into JavaScript
                understandable by browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Less relevant (back end) technologies: <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank">Node</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express</a>, <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/" target="_blank">Mongoose</a> with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
